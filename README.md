 Hi there! 👋

🚀 About me 

👱🏼‍♂️ My name is Péter Kormos
🇭🇺 I'm from Hungary, living currently in Budapest.

I've just started learning to program. I am very excited about it. I have already participated in a few u-demy courses, but now a new chapter begins in my life. I hope that in the future I will be ableto give more detail of what I am working on, of what I am currently learning and so on...
